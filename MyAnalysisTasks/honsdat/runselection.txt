5.36 general purpose anchored to 2024, has enough data available

THIS HAS NOT WORKED AT ALL REEE, can't read from grid alien_ls doesn't list the ao2d files, alien.py and cd'ing around does let you spot the files
Ok lets try another one with the completed flag then alien.py does see the files

Opting for another run with a completed flag:

to compare the above issues with.

THE DIRECTORY IN THE ao2d.collections.xml is not the same as the desired ones..... it's /number/number/whatever, not /number/aod/number.....



Figuring out the data multiple tracks with the same entries:
		>>> MCHMID.csv file If only MCHMID >0 &&  && track.chi2MatchMCHMFT() <0 :SO only mchmid matches with no mft matching: 9319 unique track ID's with 9341 total tracks: 22 Duplicate ID's
		>>>no_filt.csv file If NO filters on ID uniqueness or MCH/MFT matches: ALL tracks, bad & dupes: 11897 Unique entries, with 23880 entries total -assumng 2 of each ID: 86 unaccounted
		for - no-duplicaates or tripple duplicates.
		What can we see from this though? we see that there are 3 types of tracks:
chi2		chi2MatchMCHMID	chi2MatchMCHMFT
0.515625	1.21875	-1
370688		1.21875	36
1000	-1	17.125
0.337891	-1	-1
-1 in one, the other, neither, or Both

The selection criteria of selecting the least chi2 options for a given particle id exclusively yields the mchmid matches or the double -1 matches
